# on your document and answer the following questions.

# quiz rules:
# - There is no talking during the quiz
# - You may only use your classnotes and w3schools.com for reference
# - If you have a question about a quiz question, please raise your hand
# - Once finished, submit your code to your repository using the source control 
# button. Your commit should be "completed quiz 1."

# 1. Name and describe three (3) built-in functions in python. 
# Please write your responses in complete sentences.
"Three built in functions are input functions, special note, and string concatenation."
# 2. What data type will the following snippet of code output?
print(30/ 232)
"This will result in a float data type"
# 3.  Identify and name the operator family each of the following
# symbols belongs to.

# and
# ==
# >
" == Is from the Comparison Operator Family"
" And is from the Logical Operator Family"
" > is from the Comparison Operator Family"
# 4. Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator.
# Please write your response in complete sentences.
"The difference between the = operator and the == operator is that = assigns values and == compares values."
# 5. Write code that takes a userâ€™s input (as a string), 
# casts it to a float, and prints the result multiplied by 2.
number = input() 
zzz = float(number)
print(str(zzz * 2))
# 6. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
# Please write your response in complete sentences.
"The difference between a parameter and an argument is that a parameter sets a limit for the function and the argument sets up the function"
# 7. What is the difference between a function definition 
# and a function invocation? # Please write your response in 
# complete sentences.
" A function definition passes data and executes the function while a function invocation calls the function."
# 8. Why are functions useful in programming? Provide at least two reasons 
# and write your reasons in in complete sentences.
"Because they can perform complex things easier and can execute code as soon as it is written."
# 9. Write a code block that uses the appropriate operator for each scenario
x = 15
y = 20.
# x is greater than y
# x and 15 are both the same
# x and y are not the same`
print ( x > y )
print ( x == 15)
print ((x==y))
# 10. Create a function that will take in two values. Your function should
# take in 1 value as a parameter, and the other value should be passed in by the
# user through the terminal. Your function should compare if the number passed in by
# the user is greater than the number passed in via the parameter and should print out
# the appropriat response of true or false.
